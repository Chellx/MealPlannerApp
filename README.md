# Meal Planner App
For my 3rd year project I chose to create a mobile application specifically for the elderly to help them with meal planning.
This app will help older people when planning meals. It will provide them with recipe recommendations for the week based on their needs.

!This project now uses SQLite instead of Firebase for the database!

# Goals
The main goals for this project are:
* Create an application to allow the elderly to plan nutritious meals for the week.
* Reduce the effort needed to plan meals.
* Reduce stress caused by planning food shopping.
* Allow the elderly to retain their independance.
* Comfortably use the app no matter their experience level.
* Allow nutritionist to use the app also to register patient's detials and to recommend food and recipes to their patients.
